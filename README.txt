# Sum of Odd and Even Numbers in an Array

This is a simple JavaScript program that iterates through an array of numbers, calculates the sum of the odd and even numbers separately, and outputs the results.

## Features
- Takes an array of integers as input.
- Separates the even and odd numbers.
- Sums the even and odd numbers individually.
- Outputs the sum of both even and odd numbers.

## How It Works
1. The program initializes two variables, `sumEven` and `sumOdd`, to store the sum of even and odd numbers, respectively.
2. It then iterates through the array of numbers using a `for` loop.
3. For each number in the array:
   - If the number is even (`number % 2 === 0`), it is added to `sumEven`.
   - If the number is odd (`number % 2 !== 0`), it is added to `sumOdd`.
4. After the loop completes, the program outputs the sum of the even numbers and the sum of the odd numbers.
